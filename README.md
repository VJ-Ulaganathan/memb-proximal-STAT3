## Welcome to the Supplementary Data Page

This page contains the graphical illustrations and raw data from the TraPS-VarI analyses of human genotyping datasets, identifying all the human receptor variants "CREATING" a membrane-proximal STAT3 binding sites. Being germline encoded, such variants elevate levels of tyrosine phosphorylated (pY705) STAT3 in cells and tissues where expression is found. Thus amplitude of STAT3 signaling is enhanced in individuals baseed on their genotypes. For selected variants, expression patterns in immune cells are graphically illustrated. Here we report the identification of the pleiotropic immune evasive functions of STAT3-enhancing receptor variants.
